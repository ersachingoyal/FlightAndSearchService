We have used dotenv package here to create the environment variables.
need to install sequalize , sequalize-cli and mysql2. 
sequalize is the orm (object relational mapper), sequalize-cli will help us setting up all the database config on its own, and the mysql2 is used to connect sequlaize with the mysql server

we will do npx sequelize init to setup the db structures , but always do this in root directory as inside any folder it will remove the folders of that folder

all the folders that npx sequelize init created we have move them inside the src folder
inside config.json we need to setup our db details


used this command npx sequelize model:generate --name City --attributes name:String to generate the model using the sequelize cli

in the modes/city.js - these constraints will be added on the js level and migrations constraint will be applied on the db level


npx sequelize db:migrate then used this command to create the tabkes actually , this will help migrate the db

we should interact with our models through repository file

 npx sequelize db:migrate:undo   --> to drop the migration, if we have made some changes in the contraints of the DB , then we have to run this command and again run the migrate command
